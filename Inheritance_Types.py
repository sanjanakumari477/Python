There are five types of inheritance in Python.

They are:

1.Single Inheritance – One child inherits from one parent

2.Multiple Inheritance – One child inherits from multiple parents

3.Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from another derived class

4.Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple children inherit from one parent

5.Hybrid Inheritance – Combination of two or more types of inheritance

📌 Python supports all five types.

🔹 Why use super()?

To call parent class constructor

To reuse parent class methods
