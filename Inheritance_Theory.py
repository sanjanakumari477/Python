What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is an OOPS concept in which one class (child/subclass) acquires the properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).

👉 It allows code reuse, method extension, and hierarchical classification.

Definition (Interview-ready):

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors.

🔹 Why Inheritance is Needed?

✔ Code reusability

✔ Reduces duplication

✔ Easy maintenance

✔ Improves readability

✔ Supports method overriding

✔ Models real-world relationships

class Parent:
    # parent class code

class Child(Parent):
    # child class code
