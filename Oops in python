What is OOPS in Python?

OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach where we design programs using classes and objects instead of only functions and logic.

👉 Python is a fully object-oriented language.

Why use OOPS?

Code becomes clean & structured

Reusability of code

Easy maintenance

Better security

Easy to manage large projects

🔹 Key Concepts of OOPS in Python

There are 6 main OOPS concepts:

Class

Object

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

1️⃣ Class
What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.

 Example:
Class = Design of a house
Object = Actual house built from that design

Syntax:
class Student:
    name = "Sanjana"
    age = 22

2️⃣ Object
What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.

Example:
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)
print(s1.age)

Output:
Sanjana
22
